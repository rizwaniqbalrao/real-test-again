# MongoDB Migration Status

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Successfully migrated from Prisma/Drizzle to MongoDB with Mongoose
- ✅ Created Mongoose models (User, VerificationLog, SyncLog)
- ✅ Created compatibility layer in `src/lib/db.ts` to provide a Prisma-like interface
- ✅ Fixed MongoDB connection issue (environment variable name mismatch)
- ✅ Verified MLS data is accessible (4,982 listings, 1,752 agents)
- ✅ Verified authentication providers are working

## Current State
- The application is now successfully connected to MongoDB
- MLS data is accessible and can be queried
- Authentication functionality is properly configured
- User collection exists but currently has no records

## Next Steps
1. Set up user registration/login to create users in the MongoDB database
2. Run end-to-end tests to ensure all functionality works as expected
3. Verify data syncing works correctly
4. Clean up any remaining Prisma/Drizzle references if there are any
5. Consider adding database validation and indexing for performance optimization

## Testing Endpoints
We've created several test endpoints to verify the migration:
- `GET /api/test-db` - Check database connection status
- `GET /api/test-mls` - Check MLS data (listings and agents)
- `GET /api/test-users` - Check User model/collection

## Notes
- The MongoDB connection string should be provided as `MONGODB_URI` in the `.env.local` file
- Authentication is working but requires user creation to fully test
