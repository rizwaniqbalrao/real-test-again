# MLS Integration Cleanup Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ MongoDB with Mongoose is used for MLS data
- ✅ Migrated authentication to use MongoDB
- ✅ Created compatibility layer for Prisma to MongoDB transition
- ✅ Created User, VerificationLog, and SyncLog models
- ✅ Removed Prisma and Drizzle dependencies from package.json

## Migration Progress
1. ✅ Create MongoDB connection utility (mongodb.ts)
2. ✅ Update auth.ts to use MongoDB instead of NextAuth
3. ✅ Remove Prisma-related files
4. ✅ Remove Drizzle-related files
5. ✅ Update package.json to remove unused dependencies
6. ✅ Remove Prisma/Drizzle-related scripts from package.json
7. ⚠️ Test the application to ensure all functionality works as expected
   - Needed to create a compatibility layer (db.ts) for a smooth transition
8. ⚠️ Clean up and remove any other references to Prisma/Drizzle in the codebase
   - This is a gradual process; we've created the compatibility layer to make it smoother

## Next Steps
1. Gradually migrate each API route from using the compatibility layer to using the models directly
2. Refactor other components and pages that might be using Prisma directly
3. Add comprehensive data validation to the Mongoose models
4. Implement Mongoose migration scripts to handle schema changes
5. Remove the compatibility layer once all routes have been migrated

## Additional Tasks
1. ✅ Ensure environment variables are properly set (.env file)
2. ⚠️ Update any API routes that may be using Prisma directly
   - One file updated as an example (src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts)
   - Remaining files still use the compatibility layer
3. ⚠️ Check for any missing database migrations or data that needs to be transferred

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] User authentication works (login, register)
- [ ] MLS data is properly displayed and synced
- [ ] Admin functionality works as expected
- [ ] All API routes function correctly
- [ ] No errors in the console or logs related to database connections
